# Event Guide

A quick guide for community leaders, with tips on speaker sourcing, event promotion, and more.

## Start organizing your event

### Basic definition:
- Type of content: presentations or workshop
- Ideal format for your community: online, hybrid or in-person
- Date and time
- Duration: 1-2 hours
     - If you opt for an online event, consider breaking the event into 30-45 minute sessions.
     - For in-person event, consider a 15-minute break for participants to network.
- Theme: all events should be related to the **GitHub content defined in our learning path**. You can choose to focus on one or more themes: Intro do GitHub, Codespaces or Coding with GitHub Copilot.
- Prerequisites: If you decide host an event with a workshop, consider the prerequisites for your attendees. For example, if you are going to host a workshop on Azure, you can ask your attendees to create an Azure account before the event.

### Promotion
- Use our templates to create assets and promote your event. In the [Creative](/Creative) folder, you will find the downloadable templates:
     - Event cover for Meetup
     - Card for speakers
     - Thumbnail for YouTube
     - Power Point template
- Create the registration link for your event, using [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/), Microsoft Forms or another platform of your choice.
- Remember to include a code of conduct in your event. A CoC is important to ensure that all participants feel safe and comfortable during the event. Be inspired by the [Reactor Code of Conduct](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/CodeOfConduct/).
- Connect with local communities, universities, schools, to promote registration for your event.
- 5 and 2 days prior to the event, send a reminder email to your attendees list and encourage them to share the event with their friends and co-workers.
- On the day of the event, send a final reminder with link to access the online event or tips to find the location (if in-person).
